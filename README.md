# brainf
Making a brainf*ck compiler in 24 hours, using the C++ programming language. Compiles to x64 assembly.

## Building

### Windows
- Make sure to have [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) installed.
- Use MSYS2 as I could not get the linker.exe working.
- Open visual studio and Press f5.

### Linux
It was a 24 hour challenge so only supported on windows. Linux support coming soon.
